# Getting ready for fonts

Notice that the yaml at the beginning of this file includes a latex_engine which will be used 
when creating a pdf document.

It also includes a mainfont setting called _DejaVu Sans_.  This is not the only font that will 
work to produce the spark graphs. However, it is a free font available through the
`extrafont` package.  If you have not installed extrafont you should do so using the normal
package installation procedures. You should then make sure that the desired font is installed.

The code below will not run automatically when you knit, instead you should run it in the
console. 

```
install.packages(c("extrafont"))
font_install("DejaVu Sans")
```

If there are any difficulties please read the extrafont documentation.

 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(pander)
library(knitr)
library(skimr)

```

Try knitting this document to PDF, HTML, doc or any other format you wish to try. You 
will notice that there are slight differences between them.  To understand the impact
of the engine and font choices you should experiment with different options.

## Plain printing

The first example shows what printing the basic skim function looks like.  You can try 
knitting to different formats to see how it changes.

```{r }
skim(iris)
```

It is possible that the histograms will not print in all of the formats.

## Kable example

Kable is a function from the knitr package that provides formatting of tables.
To use kable() you should add `results='asis'` as a code chunk option.

````{r results='asis'}

skim(iris) %>% kable()

````

# Pander example 

Pander is a package that provides advanced formatting for tables. There are two formats for
pander, `results='asis'` and `results='markdown'`. Markdown will display in the same way 
as the results show in the console. You may prefer this layout in the console to the default
layout. 

```{r }
panderOptions('knitr.auto.asis', FALSE)
skim(iris) %>% pander()
```

In this case it may be that the histograms do not print in PDFs or another format 
(even though the histograms may display in the console when using the same code). 
This is because the basic font for "as is" in PDf does not includ building blocks

The code chunk options can be changed to use asis (`results='asis'`). 
However because of an issue in pandoc the subheadings showing the types
for the separte tables will not display

```{r results='asis'}

skim(iris) %>% pander()
```
